- I took this robot to the scientific communication session 2024 organised by the university representing my robotics club. That is where i learned to create this version of the robot.
- The brains of the line follower robot are represented by the arduino uno r3 mainboard coded in arduino IDE. The robot has two wheels (electric motors) in front and a bearing that it rests on for the back. 
- The sensor is a BFD 1000 module that consists of 5 IR sensors that can detect the difference between a black and a white surface and enables the rover to detect lines and obstacles along its way.
- The entire assembly sits on an acrylic piece and the boards are carefully alligned using plastic screws and washers.
- The system is powered by a usb battery bank for a long-lasting and clean 5V DC supply.
